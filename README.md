# Tailwind CSS Hover Effect Not Working

This repository demonstrates a common issue in Tailwind CSS where hover effects don't work as expected. The issue occurs when the hover state styles are not applied to an element when hovering over it.

## Problem
The provided code snippet shows a div element with a red background that is supposed to change to blue when the user hovers over it. However, this hover effect does not work. The `hover:bg-blue-700` class does not seem to take any effect. This issue might be due to one of the following reasons:

* Conflicting CSS styles
* Incorrect class names
* Missing or incorrect Tailwind CSS setup
* Incorrect HTML structure

## Solution
The solution involves checking for conflicting styles, verifying the correctness of the Tailwind CSS setup and classes, and ensuring the correct HTML structure.  If the problem persists, other potential sources of conflict such as JavaScript or other CSS frameworks should be investigated.  Sometimes restarting the development server helps as well.
